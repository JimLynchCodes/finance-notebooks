Some jupyter notebooks for finance stuf...

## Widgets

If the widgets don't render properly, and just show up like this, for example:
```
Checkbox(value=True, description='March 25, 2024')
```

then you probably need to run this to add the widgets extension:
```
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```
